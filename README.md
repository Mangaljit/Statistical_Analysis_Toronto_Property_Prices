Objectives:

1. Demonstrate the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem on the dataset (scraped in one of our previous projects) containing property prices in GTA. 

2. Estimate the mean property price (i.e. the population mean) in GTA and construct the 95 % confidence interval for the population mean price using the Central Limit Theorem.

3. Perform the statistical Z-test on the randomly selected 50 samples from the three regions 'Kitchener', 'Scugog' and 'Richmond Hill' to check if the mean property price in these regions is significantly different compared to the population mean.

4. Perform the statistical T-test on all the regions in GTA to determine if their mean property price is significantly different compared to the population mean.

5. Perform the two-sample T-test on the following pairs of regions to check if the mean property prices in these regions differ from each other.

      ['King', 'Oakville']

      ['Brampton', 'Mississauga']

      ['Oshawa', 'Ajax']

      ['Aurora', 'Richmond Hill']
